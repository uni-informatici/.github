# What is this REPO for

If you don't know it yet, .github is a special repo that an organization can create.
Specific file paths in this repo are treated as information from github to display on the webpage, for instance take a look at `profile/README.md`

That's it, just useful stuff

Additionally, we got `ART` integrated right here
